# PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This project performed as part of the _ML Zoomcamp Course_, Capstone Project. This course is conducted by [Alexey Grigorev](https://bit.ly/3BxeAoB)

## Yoga Posture Image Classification By Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)

### Data Refrence
This Model was built using [kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/suradechk/yoga-posture-cleaned).

Yoga posture dataset obtain from three following sites and applied basic data cleaning manually:
* Open source dataset from [kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/general/192938)
* 3D synthetic dataset from [aurencemoroney](https://laurencemoroney.com/2021/08/23/yogapose-dataset.html)
* Yoga-82 dataset from [google](https://sites.google.com/view/yoga-82/home)

(P.S. Prepared in Kaggle)
